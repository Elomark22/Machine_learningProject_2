This project is about predicting heart disease based on the a variety of features : 'age', 'sex', 'cp', 'trestbps', 'chol', 'fbs', 'restecg', 'thalach',
       'exang', 'oldpeak', 'slope', 'ca', 'thal' given in the dataset.
  I trained machine learning model with difference machine learning algorithms and their percentage accuracies were recorded in comparison.
  We can see that 'ca' is the most important feature of our independent variable.
